Part programming in NC (Numerical Control) machining involves creating a set of instructions, typically in the form of a code, that directs a machine tool to produce a specific part or component. These instructions control the movements of the machine's cutting tool(s) relative to the workpiece, specifying parameters such as toolpaths, cutting speeds, and depths of cut. Part programming is essential for automating the manufacturing process and ensuring accurate and efficient production of parts.
