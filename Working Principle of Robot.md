### Construction of Industrial Robots

Industrial robots are sophisticated systems composed of several key components that work together to perform automated tasks. Here’s an overview of the main parts:

1. **Manipulator (Robot Arm):**
   - **Structure:** The manipulator is the physical arm of the robot, typically composed of multiple rigid segments connected by joints. These joints can be rotary (allowing rotational movement) or linear (allowing translational movement).
   - **Degrees of Freedom (DOF):** The number of independent movements the robot arm can perform. Common industrial robots have 4 to 6 DOF.

2. **End Effector:**
   - **Types:** Grippers, welding torches, spray guns, vacuum cups, or specialized tools.
   - **Function:** The end effector is attached to the end of the robot arm and interacts with the workpiece or environment. It is interchangeable depending on the task.

3. **Actuators:**
   - **Types:** Electric motors (commonly servo motors), hydraulic actuators, pneumatic actuators.
   - **Function:** Actuators drive the movements of the robot’s joints, enabling precise control of position and force.

4. **Sensors:**
   - **Types:** Position sensors (encoders, resolvers), force/torque sensors, vision systems (cameras), proximity sensors.
   - **Function:** Sensors provide feedback about the robot's position, orientation, and interaction with its environment. They are essential for accuracy and adaptability.

5. **Controller:**
   - **Components:** Central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output (I/O) interfaces.
   - **Function:** The controller processes input from sensors, executes the programmed instructions, and sends commands to the actuators. It is the brain of the robot, coordinating all activities.

6. **Power Supply:**
   - **Types:** Electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic.
   - **Function:** Provides the necessary energy to actuate the robot's movements and operate the control systems.

7. **Human-Machine Interface (HMI):**
   - **Types:** Touchscreens, control panels, computers.
   - **Function:** Allows human operators to interact with the robot, input commands, monitor status, and troubleshoot issues.

### Working Principle of Industrial Robots

The working principle of an industrial robot involves several key processes, which include programming, initialization, task execution, feedback and adjustments, and safety mechanisms.

1. **Programming:**
   - **Methods:** Teaching (manual guidance), offline programming (simulation software), online programming (direct command input).
   - **Process:** The robot is programmed with a set of instructions that define the tasks it needs to perform. This can involve defining paths, positions, speeds, and actions for the end effector.

2. **Initialization:**
   - **Process:** Upon powering up, the robot initializes its systems. The controller checks all components and calibrates the robot’s position using sensors.

3. **Task Execution:**
   - **Input Processing:** The controller receives inputs from sensors and programmed instructions. For instance, if the robot is picking an object, it uses vision sensors to locate the object.
   - **Path Planning:** The controller calculates the optimal path for the robot arm to follow, considering factors like speed, accuracy, and obstacle avoidance. This involves solving inverse kinematics equations to determine the joint angles required to position the end effector at the desired location.
   - **Command Transmission:** The controller sends precise commands to the actuators to move the joints along the planned path. Servo motors adjust the angles of the joints, while hydraulic or pneumatic actuators provide the necessary force and movement.

4. **Feedback and Adjustments:**
   - **Sensors:** Continuously provide feedback to the controller about the robot’s position, speed, and interaction with the environment.
   - **Real-time Adjustments:** If there are deviations from the planned path or unexpected obstacles, the controller makes real-time adjustments to correct the movements, ensuring high precision and accuracy.

5. **Task Completion:**
   - **Process:** The robot completes the task as programmed. For example, it might pick up an object, weld a joint, or assemble a component. Once the task is done, the robot may move to the next position or task as specified by the program.

6. **Safety and Error Handling:**
   - **Safety Systems:** Industrial robots are equipped with safety systems to protect human workers and the robot itself. This includes emergency stop functions, collision detection, and safe operating zones.
   - **Error Handling:** In case of errors or malfunctions, the robot can stop operations and alert human operators for troubleshooting. Advanced robots can also diagnose issues and suggest corrective actions.

### Conclusion

The construction of an industrial robot involves integrating various mechanical, electronic, and software components to create a system capable of performing precise and repetitive tasks. The working principle of an industrial robot is based on executing programmed instructions through a coordinated process involving sensors, controllers, actuators, and feedback mechanisms. This allows the robot to operate autonomously and efficiently in industrial environments, improving productivity and consistency while reducing human labor and error.
