Search and rescue humanoid robots are designed to assist in locating and rescuing victims in disaster scenarios, where human intervention may be difficult or dangerous. These robots are equipped with sensors, mobility systems, and communication capabilities to navigate through hazardous environments, identify survivors, and provide assistance until human responders can reach them. Here are a few examples of search and rescue humanoid robots:

1. **Atlas**: Developed by Boston Dynamics, Atlas is a humanoid robot designed for a variety of tasks, including search and rescue operations. It is equipped with advanced mobility systems, including articulated legs and arms, as well as sensors for perception and navigation. Atlas can traverse rough terrain, climb stairs, and manipulate objects, making it suitable for assisting in disaster scenarios.

2. **RoboSimian**: Developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), RoboSimian is a versatile search and rescue robot with a unique four-limbed design. It is capable of both walking and climbing, allowing it to navigate through debris and rubble in disaster zones. RoboSimian is equipped with cameras, sensors, and manipulators for performing various tasks, such as locating survivors and clearing obstacles.

3. **HRP-2**: Developed by Kawada Industries and AIST in Japan, HRP-2 is a humanoid robot designed for disaster response and rescue operations. It is equipped with cameras, sensors, and communication devices for navigating through hazardous environments and identifying survivors. HRP-2 can also manipulate objects and perform tasks such as opening doors and operating equipment.

4. **DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Robots**: Several humanoid robots were developed as part of the DARPA Robotics Challenge, a competition aimed at advancing robotic technologies for disaster response. These robots, including those developed by teams such as Team MIT, Team IHMC, and Team KAIST, were equipped with sensors, communication systems, and manipulation capabilities for performing search and rescue tasks in simulated disaster scenarios.

5. **REEM**: Developed by PAL Robotics, REEM is a humanoid robot designed for various applications, including search and rescue operations. It is equipped with sensors, cameras, and communication devices for navigating through complex environments and interacting with humans. REEM's robust design and mobility capabilities make it suitable for assisting in disaster response efforts.

These search and rescue humanoid robots demonstrate the potential of robotics technology to assist in disaster scenarios by providing reconnaissance, locating survivors, and performing tasks that are too dangerous or challenging for humans. As robotic capabilities continue to advance, these robots are expected to play an increasingly important role in disaster response and recovery operations.
