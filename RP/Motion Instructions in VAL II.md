- **Control Flow:**
    
    - **IF-THEN-ELSE:** Executes a block of code conditionally based on a boolean expression.
    - **FOR Loop:** Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
    - **WHILE Loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    - **GOTO:** Jumps to a specific location in the program (use with caution for structured programs).
    - **SUBROUTINE Calls:** Invokes pre-defined functions within the program for modularity.
    
- **Data Handling:**
    
    - **Variable Declaration and Assignment:** Creates and assigns values to variables of different data types (integers, strings, booleans, arrays).
    - **Mathematical Operations:** Performs arithmetic operations on numerical data.
    - **String Manipulation:** Functions for working with text data (may be limited in VAL-II).
    
- **I/O (Input/Output):**
    
    - **SIGNAL:** Controls external digital and analog signals for communication with peripherals.
    - **SHIFT REGISTER:** Transfers data between the robot controller and external devices.
    
- **Error Handling:**
    
    - **TRY-CATCH:** Attempts a block of code and handles potential errors gracefully. (May not be directly available in VAL-II, but error handling mechanisms might exist).
    

### Q.7. Motion Instructions

- **Point-to-Point (PTP):** Moves the robot arm directly from its current position to a predefined waypoint (location).
    
    - **MOVE P1:** Moves to location P1.
    - **APPROACH P2, Speed:** Moves close to location P2 at a specified speed.
    - **DEPART P3, Offset:** Moves away from location P3 with a programmed offset.
    
- **Continuous Path (CP):** Moves the robot along a smooth trajectory defined by multiple points or mathematical functions. (May not be available in all VAL-II implementations).
    
    - **CP {Path Definition}:** Executes a continuous path motion based on specified parameters.
    
- **Tool Control:**
    
    - **OPEN Gripper:** Opens the gripper to release an object.
    - **CLOSE Gripper:** Closes the gripper to grasp an object.
    - **ABOVE/BELOW:** Moves the tool (end-effector) above or below a specified position.
    

### Q.8. Monitor Command Instructions

Monitor commands are used for program development and management outside of robot execution.

- **Program Management:**
    
    - **EDIT (Program Name):** Opens a program for creation or modification.
    - **STORE (Program Name):** Saves the program to permanent storage.
    - **READ (Program Name):** Loads a program from storage into memory.
    - **LIST (Program Name):** Displays the program code on the monitor.
    - **PRINT (Program Name):** Prints the program code to a physical device (e.g., printer).
    - **DIRECTORY:** Lists the names of programs stored in memory or on a device.
    - **ERASE (Program Name):** Deletes a program from memory or storage.
    
- **Program Execution:**
    
    - **EXECUTE (Program Name):** Starts the robot arm and executes the specified program. (May be abbreviated as EX or EXEC).
    - **ABORT/STOP:** Immediately halts robot motion during program execution.
    
- **System Control:**
    - **SPEED Speed:** Sets the default speed for robot movements.
    - **RESET:** Resets the robot controller to its initial state.
    - **BACKGROUND:** Runs a program in the background while allowing interaction with the monitor. (May not be available in all VAL-II implementations).
