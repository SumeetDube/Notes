1. LISTL:
    - This command is used to list the locations stored in the robot's memory.
    - It displays the names of the defined locations, which are typically used for positioning the robot or as waypoints for its movements.
2. PCABORT:
    - PCABORT stands for "Program Abort."
    - It is used to terminate the execution of the currently running program.
    - When this command is executed, the robot will immediately stop its movements and exit the program.
3. RENAME:
    - This command allows you to change the name of a program, location, or other user-defined element in the robot's memory.
    - It is useful for reorganizing and maintaining the program structure.
4. DISABLE:
    - The DISABLE command is used to deactivate a specific feature or functionality of the robot.
    - It can be applied to various components, such as inputs, outputs, or even entire program sections.
5. LISTP:
    - Similar to LISTL, but for programs instead of locations.
    - It displays a list of all the programs stored in the robot's memory.
6. EXECUTE:
    - This command is used to run or execute a specific program stored in the robot's memory.
    - It instructs the robot to begin executing the instructions in the specified program.
7. RETRY:
    - The RETRY command is typically used in conjunction with error handling routines.
    - If an error occurs during program execution, the RETRY command can be used to attempt the previous operation again, potentially addressing the issue that caused the error.
8. ENABLE:
    - The opposite of DISABLE, this command is used to activate or enable a specific feature or functionality of the robot.
    - It can be applied to various components, such as inputs, outputs, or entire program sections.
9. MOVET:
    - MOVET stands for "Move Tool."
    - It is a motion command that instructs the robot to move its tool (end-effector) to a specified location or along a defined path.
    - This command is typically used for linear or joint-interpolated movements.
10. DRIVE:
    - The DRIVE command is used to control the motion of specific robot axes or joints.
    - It allows you to move individual axes or a combination of axes to specific positions or speeds.
11. APPRO:
    - APPRO is an abbreviation for "Approach."
    - This command is used to define an approach motion before reaching a specific location.
    - It is often used in combination with other motion commands to ensure smooth and collision-free movements.
12. DELAY:
    - The DELAY command introduces a pause or delay in the program execution.
    - It is typically used to allow the robot to wait for a specific amount of time before proceeding with the next instruction.
13. GRASP:
    - The GRASP command is used to control the gripping or grasping action of the robot's end-effector.
    - It can be used to open or close the gripper, or to apply a specific gripping force.

These commands cover various aspects of robot programming, including program execution, motion control, error handling, and peripheral management. They provide the flexibility and control necessary to create complex robotic applications and automate various tasks efficiently.
