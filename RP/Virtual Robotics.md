**Definition of Virtual Robotics:**

Virtual robotics refers to the simulation and emulation of robotic systems and processes within a computer-generated environment. It involves using software tools and platforms to create virtual models of robots, their components, and their interactions with the environment. Virtual robotics allows for testing, validation, and optimization of robotic designs and operations without physical implementation, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to develop and deploy robotic systems.

**Explanation of User Interfaces in Robot Studios for Various Applications:**

Robot Studio is a comprehensive software suite developed by ABB for robot programming, simulation, and offline programming. It provides a range of user interfaces tailored for different applications, including robot programming, simulation, commissioning, and maintenance.
