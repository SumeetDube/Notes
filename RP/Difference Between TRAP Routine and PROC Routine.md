1. **TRAP Routine**:

A TRAP Routine is a type of routine in RAPID that is used to handle exceptions or errors that occur during program execution. It is similar to an exception handler in other programming languages.

Example:
```
TRAP "TRAP1":
  ! Handle the exception
ENDTRAP
```

In this example, the TRAP Routine is used to handle the exception named "TRAP1".

2. **PROC Routine**:

A PROC Routine is a type of routine in RAPID that is used to define a subroutine or function. It is similar to a function or method in other programming languages.

Example:
```
PROC mySubroutine:
  ! Do something
ENDPROC
```


| **Feature**           | **TRAP Routine**                                     | **PROC Routine**                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**           | Handle exceptions or errors                          | Define a subroutine or function                                   |
| **Trigger**           | Automatically triggered when an exception occurs     | Manually called by the program                                    |
| **Scope**             | Global, can be accessed from anywhere in the program | Local, can only be accessed within the module where it is defined |
| **Return Type**       | No return value                                      | Can return a value                                                |
| **Parameter Passing** | No parameters are passed                             | Parameters can be passed                                          |
| **Error Handling**    | Used to handle errors and exceptions                 | Not used for error handling                                       |
| **Syntax**            | `TRAP "trap_name": ... ENDTRAP`                      | `PROC proc_name: ... ENDPROC`                                     |
| **Example**           | `TRAP "TRAP1": ! Handle the exception ENDTRAP`       | `PROC mySubroutine: ! Do something ENDPROC`                       |
| **Usage**             | Used to catch and handle exceptions                  | Used to modularize code and reuse functionality                   |
