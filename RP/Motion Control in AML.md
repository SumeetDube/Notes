**Motion Control**

Motion control refers to the use of computer-controlled systems to operate and regulate the movement of machines, robots, and other mechanical devices. In AML (A Manufacturing Language), motion control instructions are used to control the movement of devices such as robots, arms, and grippers.

**Motion Controls with Examples**

**MOVE**

The MOVE instruction is used to move a device to a specific location.

Example:
```
MOVE (ARM, fgoal, LED);
```
This example moves the ARM device to the fgoal position and turns on the LED.

**DMOVE**

The DMOVE instruction is used to move a device to a specific location with a specified speed and acceleration.

Example:
```
DMOVE (ARM, fgoal, 10, 20);
```
This example moves the ARM device to the fgoal position with a speed of 10 and an acceleration of 20.

**SPEED**

The SPEED instruction is used to set the speed of a device.

Example:
```
SPEED (0.8);
```
This example sets the speed of the device to 0.8.

**ACCEL**

The ACCEL instruction is used to set the acceleration of a device.

Example:
```
ACCEL (10);
```
This example sets the acceleration of the device to 10.

**DELAY**

The DELAY instruction is used to pause the program execution for a specified amount of time.

Example:
```
DELAY (1.5);
```
This example pauses the program execution for 1.5 seconds.

**WAITMOVE**

The WAITMOVE instruction is used to wait for a device to complete its movement before continuing program execution.

Example:
```
WAITMOVE (ARM);
```
This example waits for the ARM device to complete its movement before continuing program execution.

These motion control instructions in AML enable users to precisely control the movement of devices, allowing for efficient and accurate manufacturing processes.
