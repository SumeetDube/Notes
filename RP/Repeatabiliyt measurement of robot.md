Sure, here are the key points about repeatability measurement of robots in a point-to-point manner:

1. Repeatability is a measure of a robot's ability to consistently achieve the same position and orientation in space, given the same set of instructions or commands.
2. Repeatability is an essential performance metric for robotic systems, particularly in applications that require high levels of precision and accuracy.
3. Repeatability is typically measured by performing a series of tests in which the robot is commanded to move to a specific position and orientation, and then the actual position and orientation achieved by the robot are measured using a suitable sensing system.
4. The tests are repeated multiple times, and the variations in the achieved position and orientation are analyzed statistically to determine the robot's repeatability.
5. The repeatability of a robot is usually expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the position and orientation errors, which are the differences between the commanded and the achieved position and orientation.
6. A smaller standard deviation indicates a higher level of repeatability, meaning that the robot is more likely to achieve the same position and orientation consistently.
7. Repeatability is not the same as accuracy. Accuracy is a measure of how close the achieved position and orientation are to the true or intended position and orientation, while repeatability is a measure of how consistently the robot achieves the same position and orientation.
8. Factors that can affect repeatability include mechanical tolerances, joint compliance, backlash, temperature, and wear and tear.
9. Improving repeatability can be achieved through various methods, such as calibration, compensation, and control strategies that minimize the effects of the aforementioned factors.
