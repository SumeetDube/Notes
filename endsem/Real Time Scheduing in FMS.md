Real-time scheduling in a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) refers to the dynamic allocation and scheduling of manufacturing resources and operations in response to real-time events and changes in the production environment. Unlike traditional static scheduling, real-time scheduling in FMS aims to adapt and optimize the scheduling decisions based on the current state of the system, taking into account factors such as machine availability, material availability, tool conditions, and production priorities.

Real-time scheduling in FMS involves the following key aspects:

1. Monitoring and data acquisition: Sensors and data acquisition systems are used to collect real-time data from various components of the FMS, including machines, tools, materials, and work-in-progress (WIP) inventory.

2. Event detection and handling: The system continuously monitors for events or disturbances that may impact the planned schedule, such as machine breakdowns, tool failures, material shortages, or changes in production orders.

3. Rescheduling and optimization: When an event or disturbance is detected, the real-time scheduling system updates the current state of the system and generates a revised schedule to accommodate the changes. This rescheduling process aims to optimize the utilization of available resources while minimizing the impact on production goals, such as throughput, lead times, and due dates.

4. Execution and control: The updated schedule is then executed by dispatching jobs to the appropriate machines and resources, and the system continuously monitors the execution to detect and handle any further events or deviations from the planned schedule.

Example scenario:
Consider an FMS for producing automotive components, with multiple machining centers, automated material handling systems, and a central control system. Initially, the system has a planned schedule for producing a batch of engine blocks.

1. During the production run, a sensor detects a tool failure on one of the machining centers.

2. The real-time scheduling system detects this event and updates the system state, marking the affected machining center as unavailable until the tool can be replaced.

3. The rescheduling algorithm takes into account the remaining available machining centers, tool availability, material inventory, and the priority of the engine block orders. It generates a revised schedule that optimizes resource utilization and minimizes the impact on due dates.

4. The updated schedule may involve reassigning some operations to alternative machines, adjusting operation sequences, or prioritizing certain orders based on their due dates and available resources.

5. The revised schedule is executed, and the system continuously monitors its execution, ready to handle any further events or disturbances that may occur.

Real-time scheduling in FMS enables responsive and adaptive production planning, improving system efficiency, reducing downtime, and enhancing overall productivity. It is particularly beneficial in dynamic and complex manufacturing environments where disturbances and uncertainties are common, allowing the system to react and adjust to changing conditions in real-time.
