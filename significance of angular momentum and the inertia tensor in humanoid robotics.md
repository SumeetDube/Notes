>Give significance of angular momentum and the inertia tensor in humanoid robotics

In the field of humanoid robotics, angular momentum and the inertia tensor play crucial roles in motion planning, control, and stability of the robot. These concepts are particularly important when dealing with the dynamics of multi-body systems, such as humanoid robots, which have complex kinematic structures with multiple links and joints.

### 1. Angular Momentum:

Angular momentum is a fundamental quantity that describes the amount of rotation or spin an object possesses about a specific axis. In humanoid robotics, it is essential to understand and control the angular momentum of the robot's links and joints during various motions, such as walking, reaching, or balancing.

The significance of angular momentum in humanoid robotics includes:

a. Balance and Stability: Proper management of angular momentum is crucial for maintaining balance and stability during dynamic movements, such as walking or recovering from external disturbances.

b. Trajectory Planning: Angular momentum considerations are necessary for generating smooth and natural-looking trajectories for the robot's movements, ensuring that the robot can execute desired motions without losing balance or violating physical constraints.

c. Interaction with the Environment: When a humanoid robot interacts with objects or performs manipulation tasks, controlling the angular momentum of its links and end-effectors is essential for achieving desired forces and torques.

### 2. Inertia Tensor:

The inertia tensor, also known as the moment of inertia tensor, is a mathematical representation that describes the distribution of mass within a rigid body or a system of rigid bodies. It plays a crucial role in the dynamics of multi-body systems, such as humanoid robots.

The significance of the inertia tensor in humanoid robotics includes:

a. Dynamics Modeling: The inertia tensor is a key component in the equations of motion that govern the dynamics of the robot's links and joints. Accurate modeling of the inertia tensor is essential for precise control and simulation of the robot's movements.

b. Trajectory Optimization: By considering the inertia tensor, trajectory optimization algorithms can generate more efficient and energy-optimal motions for the robot, taking into account the mass distribution and inertial properties of its links.

c. Control Strategies: The inertia tensor is a critical input for advanced control strategies, such as computed torque control, inverse dynamics control, or operational space control, which aim to accurately control the robot's motion and forces.

d. Inverse Kinematics and Dynamics: The inertia tensor plays a role in solving inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics problems, which are fundamental for motion planning and control of humanoid robots.

If you try to get on a bicycle and balance without a kickstand, you will probably fall off. But once you start pedalling, these wheels pick up angular momentum. They are going to resist change, thereby making balancing gets easier.

> The property of any rotating object given by moment of inertia times angular velocity.

It is the property of a rotating body given by the product of the moment of inertia and the angular velocity of the rotating object. It is a **vector quantity**, which implies that the direction is also considered here along with magnitude.

Angular momentum (𝐿⃗L) is a vector quantity that represents the rotational analog of linear momentum. For a point particle, it is defined as the cross product of the position vector (𝑟⃗r) and the linear momentum (𝑝⃗=𝑚𝑣⃗p​=mv), where 𝑚m is the mass of the particle and 𝑣⃗v is its velocity:
