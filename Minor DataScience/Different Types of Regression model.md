	What are the different types of Regression model? Explain any one regression type in brief with suitable example.


There are several types of regression models, each suited for different types of data and modeling tasks. Some common types of regression models include:

1. **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used regression techniques. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).

2. **Polynomial Regression**: Polynomial regression extends linear regression by allowing for nonlinear relationships between the independent and dependent variables. It involves fitting a polynomial function to the data.

3. **Ridge Regression**: Ridge regression is a regularization technique used to mitigate multicollinearity and overfitting in linear regression models. It adds a penalty term to the cost function to shrink the coefficients towards zero.

4. **Lasso Regression**: Lasso regression, similar to ridge regression, is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models. It adds a penalty term to the cost function but uses the absolute values of the coefficients instead of squared values.

5. **ElasticNet Regression**: ElasticNet regression is a combination of ridge and lasso regression, which allows for both L1 and L2 regularization. It combines the advantages of both regularization techniques.

6. **Logistic Regression**: Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm commonly used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.

7. **Decision Tree Regression**: Decision tree regression involves fitting a decision tree to the data, where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents the predicted output value.

8. **Random Forest Regression**: Random forest regression is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance. It averages the predictions of multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting.
9. **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** This technique finds a hyperplane that best fits the data points while minimizing the margin of error. It's particularly useful for high-dimensional data and works well with limited datasets.
    
Let's briefly explain linear regression:

**Linear Regression**:
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning the relationship can be represented by a straight line.

The equation of a simple linear regression model with one independent variable is given by:
$$ y = mx + c $$

Where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable (target).
- \( x \) is the independent variable (feature).
- \( m \) is the slope of the line (the coefficient of the independent variable).
- \( c \) is the y-intercept (the constant term).

Example:
Let's say we want to predict the price of a house (\( y \)) based on its size in square feet (\( x \)). We collect data on the sizes and prices of several houses and fit a linear regression model to the data. The resulting equation might look like this:
\[ \text{Price} = 200 \times \text{Size} + 50000 \]

This equation indicates that for every additional square foot increase in size, the price of the house increases by $200. The y-intercept of $50,000 represents the base price of a house with zero square feet.
