	What are advantages and disadvantages of NBmodel. What are various Applications of NBmodel?



|Aspect|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|---|---|---|
|**Simplicity**|Easy to understand and implement|The naive assumption of feature independence rarely holds in real-world data|
|**Speed**|Fast training and prediction, even with large datasets|Assumes all features contribute equally and independently to the outcome|
|**Scalability**|Scales well with a large number of features|Performance can be degraded if the number of features is too high|
|**Performance**|Performs well with small to medium-sized datasets|Sensitive to irrelevant features and correlated features|
|**Memory Usage**|Requires less memory for storing the model|Requires a relatively large amount of data to make accurate predictions|
|**Probabilistic Interpretation**|Provides probabilistic predictions, which can be useful for certain applications|Can be overly confident in its predictions due to the strong independence assumption|
|**Works with Missing Data**|Can handle missing values well by simply ignoring them during probability calculation|Not robust to model mis-specifications and noise|
|**Multi-class Support**|Naturally handles multi-class classification problems|Not suitable for complex decision boundaries|
