	What is linear equation? What are the different method to solve system of linear equation. Explain with suitable example

A linear equation is an equation that forms a straight line when graphed. It is defined as an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable. The general form of a linear equation in two variables 𝑥x and 𝑦y is: 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑦=𝑐ax+by=c where 𝑎a, 𝑏b, and 𝑐c are constants.


### Linear Equation
- **Definition**: A linear equation is an equation that forms a straight line when graphed. It is in the form \( ax + by = c \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants and \( x \) and \( y \) are variables.

### Methods for Solving a System of Linear Equations

1. **Graphical Method**
   - Plot each equation on a graph.
   - The point(s) where the lines intersect are the solution(s).
   - **Example**:
     - Equations: \( x + y = 3 \) and \( x - y = 1 \).
     - Graph these lines to find the intersection point at \( (2, 1) \).

2. **Substitution Method**
   - Solve one equation for one variable.
   - Substitute this expression into the other equation.
   - Solve the resulting equation for the second variable.
   - **Example**:
     - Equations: \( x + y = 3 \) and \( x - y = 1 \).
     - Solve the first equation for \( x \): \( x = 3 - y \).
     - Substitute into the second: \( (3 - y) - y = 1 \) → \( 3 - 2y = 1 \) → \( y = 1 \).
     - Substitute \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 3 - y \): \( x = 2 \).
     - Solution: \( (2, 1) \).

3. **Elimination Method (Addition/Subtraction)**
   - Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable.
   - Solve for the remaining variable.
   - Substitute back to find the other variable.
   - **Example**:
     - Equations: \( x + y = 3 \) and \( x - y = 1 \).
     - Add the equations to eliminate \( y \): \( (x + y) + (x - y) = 3 + 1 \) → \( 2x = 4 \) → \( x = 2 \).
     - Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( x + y = 3 \): \( 2 + y = 3 \) → \( y = 1 \).
     - Solution: \( (2, 1) \).

4. **Matrix Method (Gaussian Elimination)**
   - Write the system as an augmented matrix.
   - Use row operations to reduce the matrix to row echelon form.
   - Back-substitute to find the solution.
   - **Example**:
     - Equations: \( x + y = 3 \) and \( x - y = 1 \).
