	Explain working of Naive Bayes Classifier? What are types of NB classifier. Explain in brief.

The Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with a strong (naive) assumption of feature independence. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes classifiers are widely used in various machine learning applications, especially in text classification and spam filtering.

### Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers

1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**:
    
    - Assumes that the features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.
    - Suitable for continuous or real-valued features.
    - Estimation involves computing the mean and variance of each feature for each class.
2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**:
    
    - Assumes that the features are generated from a multinomial distribution.
    - Suitable for discrete features such as word counts or frequencies.
    - Widely used in text classification tasks.
3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**:
    
    - Assumes that the features are binary or boolean.
    - Suitable for binary features representing presence or absence.
    - Commonly used in document classification and spam filtering.

### Example

Consider a simple email classification task where emails are classified as spam or non-spam (ham) based on the presence of certain words (features). To classify a new email, the NB classifier calculates the probability of it being spam or non-spam given the words in the email. The class with the highest probability is assigned to the email.

### Advantages of Naive Bayes Classifier

- Simple and easy to implement.
- Requires a small amount of training data to estimate parameters.
- Performs well in multi-class classification and is robust to irrelevant features.
- Efficient in both training and prediction, making it suitable for large datasets.

### Limitations of Naive Bayes Classifier

- Strong assumption of feature independence, which may not hold true in some cases.
- Can be sensitive to the presence of irrelevant features.
- Not suitable for tasks where complex relationships between features are important.
- Requires careful handling of missing data and zero probabilities.

### Conclusion

Naive Bayes classifiers are efficient and effective probabilistic models widely used in various machine learning applications, especially in text classification and spam filtering. By leveraging Bayes' theorem and the assumption of feature independence, Naive Bayes classifiers provide a simple yet powerful approach to classification tasks. The choice of the specific type of Naive Bayes classifier depends on the nature of the data and the problem being solved.
