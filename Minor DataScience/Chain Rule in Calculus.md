	What is the significance of chain rule in calculus? Explain chain rule with suitable example.

The chain rule is a fundamental tool in calculus for differentiating compositions of functions. It allows us to find the derivative of a composite function, i.e., a function that is composed of two or more functions. This is particularly important because many real-world phenomena can be modeled as compositions of simpler functions. The chain rule facilitates the differentiation of these complex functions, making it possible to analyze and understand rates of change in various contexts such as physics, engineering, economics, and more.

The chain rule is a fundamental tool in calculus for differentiating compositions of functions.

### Chain Rule

- **Statement**: If \( y = f(u) \) and \( u = g(x) \), then the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) is given by:
$$
  \[
  \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
  \]
$$
This means that to differentiate the composite function \( y = f(g(x)) \), we differentiate \( f \) with respect to \( u \) and multiply by the derivative of \( g \) with respect to \( x \).

### Example

Consider the function $$ y = \sin(x^2) $$

Here, \( y = f(u) = \sin(u) \) and \( u = g(x) = x^2 \).

1. **Step 1**: Differentiate \( f(u) = \sin(u) \) with respect to \( u \):
   $$
   \frac{dy}{du} = \cos(u)
