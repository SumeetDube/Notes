	What is the difference between the Jacobian, Hessian and the gradient function. Explain with example the applications of each function.

Jacobian is the determinant of the jacobian matrix. The matrix will contain all [partial derivatives](https://byjus.com/maths/partial-derivative/) of a vector function. The main use of Jacobian is found in the transformation of coordinates. It deals with the concept of differentiation with coordinate transformation
