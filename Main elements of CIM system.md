Computer-integrated machines and automation systems in manufacturing goods are a matter of reference for computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM). CIM uses a range of innovations, such as CAD and CAM, to create an error-free production process that eliminates quality issues and automates repetitive tasks. The mechanical elements of the CIM system improve manufacturing speed and automate the production process with real-time sensors and closed-loop control systems. It has significant usage in vehicles, aircraft, space, and shipbuilding.

CIM is the information technology architecture for integrated engineering, marketing, and production functions. In the broadest sense, CIM combines all corporate operations, from the retailer to the end user.

There are nine major computerized elements of CIM system:

**Marketing**: The marketing division identifies the need for a product. The marketing department also decides the specifications of the product, the projection of manufacturing quantities, and the strategy for marketing the product. Marketing also works out the manufacturing costs to assess the economic viability of the product.

**Product Design**: The companyâ€™s design department establishes the initial database for producing a proposed product. In a computerized element of a CIM system, this is accomplished through activities such as geometric modeling and computer-aided design while considering the product requirements and concepts generated by the creativity of the design engineer. Configuration management is an important activity in many designs. Complex designs are usually carried out by several teams working simultaneously, often in different parts of the world. The design process is constrained by the costs incurred in actual production and by the capabilities of the available production equipment and processes. The design process creates the database required to manufacture the part.

Planning: The planning department takes the database established by the design department and enriches it with production data and information to produce a plan for the production of the product. Planning involves several subsystems dealing with materials, facility, process, tools, workforce, capacity, scheduling, outsourcing, assembly, inspection, logistics, etc. In a computerized element
